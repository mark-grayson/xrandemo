# xRAN Background

The [xRAN Forum](www.xran.org) have specified a so-called "lower-layer split" for supporting a multi-vendor LTE and 5G Radio Acees Networks (RANs). This splits the RAN into a Radio Unit (RU) and a lower-layer split Central Unit (lls-CU). Importantly, xRAN have defined the use of NETCONF/YANG for managing their Radio Unit.


# xRAN demo overview

These demos show how NSO and Confd can be used to exercise the set of [xRAN](http://http://www.xran.org/) YANG models used to support its split RAN architecture.

The models need to be downloaded from the xRAN website public
